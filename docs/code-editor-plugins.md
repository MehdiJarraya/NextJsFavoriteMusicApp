# Code editor plugins

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/): <https://editorconfig.org/#download> or you might not need a plugin if your editor is listed at <https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed>
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): <https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors>
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/): <https://stylelint.io/user-guide/integrations/editor/>
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): <https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html>

Many common code editors may be integrated with linters to make identifying and fixing linting issues during development faster and easier. We recommend installing the appropriate plugins for your editor of choice.

For linters which provide a `fix` option to fix simple errors automatically (such as ESLint), we recommend turning on the option to “fix errors on save”, if available in the plugin.
